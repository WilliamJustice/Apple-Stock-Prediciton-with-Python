# Apple-Stock-Prediciton-with-Python

  This project was completed for the DSC 630 M.S. Program at Bellevue University. The course and project are centered around predictive analytics. I had recently began dabbling into the stock market at the time of this course and thought to myself what a great time to put this new found area of interest to work with my current course. 
   
   One of the most popular stocks at the time was Apple Inc. This made an easy decision for me to begin the data collection process. 
   
   Working with the Yahoo Finance API I created a python program to create a dataset using features such as date, high and low prices, open and close prices, volume, and the adjusted close price.
   Then I chose two models which I am realtively familiar with and also easly worked into a time series format. The two chosen models are linear regression and decision tree. 
   After working through the M.S program and taking a look back at at this previous project I realize the work that is still required for increased model accuracy. Methods such as feature selection and model validation were not done at the time. If given the opportunity I would like to go back to apply these techniques in order to compare and increase model performance.
   Even without these techniques model performance was somewhat high in the decsion tree model...Although still not strong enough to place any certainty (and more importantly money) in.
